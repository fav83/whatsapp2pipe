# Terms of Service

*Last updated: November 7, 2025*

Thank you for using chat2deal! We build it to help you connect WhatsApp conversations to Pipedrive CRM without switching tabs. These Terms of Service govern your use of our Chrome extension and website.

When we say "Company", "we", "our", or "us", we're referring to chat2deal.

When we say "Service", we mean the chat2deal Chrome extension and website.

When we say "You" or "your", we're referring to individuals or organizations using our Service.

We may update these Terms in the future. When we make significant changes, we'll update the date at the top and notify you via email if you have an account.

By using our Service, you agree to these Terms. If you violate these Terms, we may terminate your access.

## What the Service Does

chat2deal is a Chrome extension that integrates WhatsApp Web with Pipedrive CRM. It allows you to:
- Look up Pipedrive contacts based on WhatsApp phone numbers
- Create new Pipedrive contacts from WhatsApp conversations
- Link WhatsApp numbers to existing Pipedrive contacts

The Service requires authentication with your Pipedrive account via OAuth.

## Account Requirements

1. You must authenticate with a valid Pipedrive account to use the Service.
2. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Pipedrive credentials and any activity that occurs through your authenticated session.
3. You must be a human. Accounts registered by bots or automated methods are not permitted.
4. You may not use the Service for any illegal purpose or to violate laws in your jurisdiction.
5. You may not use the Service to transmit spam, malware, or harmful content.

## Chrome Extension Permissions

The Service requires specific Chrome extension permissions to function:
- **WhatsApp Web access**: To read phone numbers from active chats (data is not stored)
- **Storage**: To securely store your authentication session locally
- **Background processing**: To maintain your Pipedrive API connection

The extension only accesses WhatsApp Web (web.whatsapp.com). It does not access your WhatsApp messages, history, or contacts beyond the currently active chat's phone number.

## Pipedrive Integration

The Service connects to your Pipedrive account with the `contacts:full` permission scope, which allows:
- Reading Pipedrive contact information
- Creating new contacts
- Updating existing contacts with phone numbers

We do not access or modify Pipedrive deals, activities, notes, or other data beyond contacts.

## Current Beta Status

The Service is currently in closed beta and is provided **free of charge**. We may introduce paid plans in the future, with advance notice to existing users.

## Termination

1. You may disconnect the Service at any time by revoking OAuth access in your Pipedrive settings or uninstalling the Chrome extension.
2. Upon disconnection, your authentication session will be deleted from our servers. No contact data is stored on our servers.
3. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or use the Service in harmful ways.
4. Abuse of our team members will result in immediate termination.

## Service Modifications

We may modify or discontinue any part of the Service at any time. We're actively developing new features and may change functionality based on user feedback and technical requirements.

## Data and Privacy

1. The Service is provided "as is" without service-level guarantees. We work hard to maintain reliability and uptime.
2. We protect your data with encryption during transmission and at rest.
3. Your data is processed as described in our Privacy Policy.
4. We may access authentication logs and error reports to maintain service security and functionality.
5. Our infrastructure runs on Microsoft Azure in the United States.

We use third-party services to operate:
- **Microsoft Azure** (hosting, backend logs)
- **Pipedrive API** (CRM integration)
- **Sentry** (error tracking and monitoring)

## Intellectual Property

1. You retain ownership of your Pipedrive data. We claim no ownership of your CRM data.
2. We own all rights to the Service, including the extension code, design, and trademarks.
3. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer any part of the Service.
4. You may not use our name or logo without written permission.

## Liability Limitation

**The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the Service, including but not limited to: data loss, service interruptions, integration errors with Pipedrive, or any other issues.**

By using chat2deal, you accept this limitation of liability. We take our work seriously and invest in security, reliability, and user experience, but we cannot guarantee perfect operation.
