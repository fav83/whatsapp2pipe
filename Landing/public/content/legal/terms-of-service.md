# Terms of Service

*Last updated: November 5, 2024*

Thank you for using chat2deal! We build it to help you do your best work connecting WhatsApp conversations to your CRM. Because we can't know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.

When we say "Company", "we", "our", or "us" in this document, we're referring to chat2deal.

When we say "Service" or "chat2deal", we mean our website and service, whether delivered within a web browser, mobile application, or another format.

When we say "You" or "your", we're referring to the people or organizations that own an account with our Service.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and notify you via email.

When you use our Service, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision. **These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**

If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by keeping an open door to your feedback.

## Account Terms

1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We recommend users set up two-factor authentication for added security.
2. You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that occurs under your account.
3. You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
4. You may not use the Service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.
5. You may not use the Service to transmit spam, malware, or any harmful content.

## Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes

1. chat2deal offers a 7-day free trial. During the trial period, you can explore the Service without providing payment information. After the trial period, you need to pay to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment.
2. We charge your payment method at the start of each billing cycle. Credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn't hit our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for account history, invoicing, and billing support.
3. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.
4. If you are upgrading or downgrading your plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle.

## Cancellation and Termination

1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. You can cancel your account at any time through your account settings. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can always contact us at info@chat2deal.com.
2. All of your content will be inaccessible from the Service immediately upon account cancellation. We cannot recover this information once your account has been canceled.
3. If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up period, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again.
4. We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Service for any reason at any time. Suspension means you will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the thousands of accounts on our Service, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance.
5. Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of any of our team members will result in immediate account termination.

## Modifications to the Service and Prices

1. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Service with or without notice. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Service because we think it could be better.
2. Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our Service. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record.

## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. We provide the Service on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We don't offer service-level agreements, but we do take uptime of our application seriously.
2. We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Service. Of course, we'll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.
3. We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet.
4. When you use our Service, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that chat2deal may process your data as described in our Privacy Policy and for no other purpose. We may access your data for the following reasons:
   - **To help you with support requests you make.** We'll ask for express consent before accessing your account.
   - **To safeguard chat2deal.** We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Service as a whole.
   - **To the extent required by applicable law.** If we are compelled by a valid legal order, we may need to preserve or share customer data. If chat2deal is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.
5. We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. All content posted on the Service must comply with U.S. copyright law.
2. You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you in order to provide the Service to you, but we claim no ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to the Service remain yours.
3. We do not pre-screen content, but we reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.
4. We own all right, title, and interest in and to the Service, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Service as a result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written permission from us. You must request permission to use our logos for promotional purposes. Please email us at info@chat2deal.com with requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind any permissions if you violate these Terms.
5. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without our express written permission.

## Features and Bugs

We design our Service with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Service will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Service inevitably has some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely error-free Service.

## Liability

We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

***You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Service; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Service; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms or the Service, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.***

In other words: choosing to use our Service does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that's on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general giving a damn. If you choose to use our Service, thank you for betting on us.

## General Terms

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.

If you have a question about any of these Terms, please contact us at info@chat2deal.com.
