# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: November 5, 2024*

The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours!—is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

This policy applies to chat2deal and all related services we provide.

## What We Collect and Why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:

### Identity and Access

When you sign up for chat2deal, we ask for identifying information such as your name and email address. That's so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you product updates and other essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you use our Service and to make improvements. With your consent, we will send you our newsletter and other updates.

We'll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Billing Information

If you sign up for a paid chat2deal subscription, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address. Credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn't hit our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address so we can charge you for service, calculate any sales tax due, send you invoices, and detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We occasionally use aggregate billing information to guide our marketing efforts.

### Product Interactions

We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in your chat2deal account. This is so you can use our Service as intended. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we'll delete the content.

### General Geolocation Data

We log the full IP address used to sign up a product account and retain that for use in mitigating future spammy signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.

### Website Interactions

We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they took to load, and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are signed in, these web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer active.

### Anti-bot Assessments

We use CAPTCHA across our application to mitigate brute force logins and as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our app and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing attacks and spam. When you log into your chat2deal account and when you fill in certain forms, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program instead of a human. The CAPTCHA service then provides us with the spam score results; we do not have access to the evaluated information.

### Advertising and Cookies

We may run contextual ads on various third-party platforms such as Google, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Users who click on one of our ads will be sent to the chat2deal website. Where permissible under law, we may load an ad-company script on their browsers that sets a third-party cookie and sends information to the ad network to enable evaluation of the effectiveness of our ads, e.g., which ad they clicked and which keyword triggered the ad, and whether they performed certain actions such as clicking a button or submitting a form.

We also use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our application, and perform A/B testing as well as support some analytics.

A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although our app won't work and other aspects of our service may not function properly if you turn cookies off.

### Voluntary Correspondence

When you email us with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so with your express consent.

## When We Access or Disclose Your Information

**To provide products or services you've requested.** We use some third-party service providers to help run our application and provide the Service to you. We also use third-party processors for other business functions such as managing newsletter subscriptions, sending customer surveys, and payment processing.

**To exclude you from seeing our ads.** Where permissible by law and if you have a chat2deal account, we may disclose a one-way hash of your email address with ad companies to exclude you from seeing our ads.

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.** Accessing a customer's account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us, and we do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we discover you are using our Service for a restricted purpose, we will take action as necessary, including notifying appropriate authorities where warranted.

**Aggregated and de-identified data.** We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Service. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including marketing or analytics.

**When required under applicable law.** chat2deal is a U.S. company and all data infrastructure are located in the U.S.

* **Requests for user data.** Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to disclose data, we must comply. It is our policy to notify affected users before we disclose data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.

* **Preservation requests.** Similarly, our policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not disclose preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period.

* **If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to disclose billing-related information.** If that happens, we will disclose only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

Finally, if chat2deal is acquired by or merges with another company—we don't plan on that, but if it happens—we'll notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Your Rights with Respect to Your Information

At chat2deal, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure / "To Be Forgotten".** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using chat2deal services because our application may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of your personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
* **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
* **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party. If you want to export data from your account, you can do so by contacting us at info@chat2deal.com.
* **Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our Service, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Service.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our Service to you.

In some cases, we also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at info@chat2deal.com.

## How We Secure Your Data

All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. In addition, we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

## What Happens When You Delete Content in Your Product Account

If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become immediately inaccessible. This applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for auto-canceled accounts.

## Location of Site and Data

Our Service and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, **please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States**. By using our Service and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.

## Children's Privacy

chat2deal is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us with personal information, please contact us at info@chat2deal.com.

## Changes and Questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and notify you via email.

Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at info@chat2deal.com and we'll be happy to try to answer them!
