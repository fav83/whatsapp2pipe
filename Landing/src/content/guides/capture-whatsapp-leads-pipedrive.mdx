Looking for a **WhatsApp Pipedrive integration** that actually works? If you're in sales, you know the drill: you're in the middle of a promising conversation on WhatsApp, the prospect is interested, and suddenly you realize—none of this is in your CRM.

To log it, you have to stop chatting, open Pipedrive, create a new person, copy the phone number, copy the name, create a deal, and then copy-paste the important notes. By the time you're done, the momentum is gone, and you've wasted precious minutes on data entry.

It's no wonder so many WhatsApp leads never make it into Pipedrive. But "if it's not in the CRM, it didn't happen."

## The Solution: Chat2Deal

**Chat2Deal** is a lightweight Chrome extension that brings Pipedrive directly into WhatsApp Web. Instead of switching tabs, you get a dedicated sidebar that lets you capture leads, create deals, and save notes—all without leaving your conversation.

Unlike complex automation tools that require business API verification or expensive shared inboxes, Chat2Deal works with your **existing WhatsApp account** and installs in seconds.

When you open a chat, it detects who you're talking to and instantly searches your Pipedrive database. If they exist, it shows their details and open deals. If they don't, it lets you add them as a contact with one click.

## Step 1: Install and Connect

Getting started takes less than a minute. We designed Chat2Deal to be "install and go."

1. **Install the Extension:** Add Chat2Deal to Chrome from the <ChromeStoreLink>Web Store</ChromeStoreLink>.
2. **Open WhatsApp Web:** Refresh your WhatsApp Web tab. You'll see a new sidebar appear on the right side of your screen.
3. **Sign In:** Click "Sign in with Pipedrive." This uses the official Pipedrive OAuth connection, so your credentials remain secure.

Once connected, the sidebar will immediately react to your current chat.

## Step 2: Create a New Contact from WhatsApp

Here is the most common scenario: a new lead messages you. Usually, you'd have to copy their phone number and switch tabs. With Chat2Deal, the sidebar automatically detects that this phone number isn't in Pipedrive yet.

1. Open the chat with the new lead.
2. The sidebar displays a "Person not found" status.
3. The form auto-fills the **Name** (from their WhatsApp profile) and **Phone Number**.
4. Click the **Create** button.

That's it. The contact is now in Pipedrive. No copy-pasting required.

## Step 3: Attach a Number to an Existing Person

Sometimes you're chatting with someone you *know* is in your CRM, but maybe they're messaging from a new number or their personal phone.

Instead of creating a duplicate contact, use the **Attach phone** feature:

1. In the sidebar, click the **Search contact…** field.
2. Search for the contact’s name (e.g., “John Smith”).
3. Select the correct profile from the results.
4. Click **Attach number**.

Chat2Deal updates their existing Pipedrive profile with this new WhatsApp number, keeping your data clean and unified.

## Step 4: Save Chat Messages as Notes

Even with contacts synced, important details can get lost in long chat threads. You can save specific messages as notes attached to the Pipedrive contact.

1. In the sidebar, scroll to the **Create Note from Chat** section.
2. Click **Select messages**. Chat2Deal will extract the latest messages from the conversation.
3. Select the specific messages you want to save.
4. Click **Create Note**.

The selected messages are formatted and saved to the person's Pipedrive profile instantly.

## Stop Losing Leads to "I'll Do It Later"

Manual data entry is a friction point where sales teams lose revenue every day, simply because valuable context stays trapped in WhatsApp chats. By removing that friction, you ensure every lead is actually captured and every conversation is tracked.
