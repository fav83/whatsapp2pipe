If you work in sales, you know the drill: you're in the middle of a promising conversation on WhatsApp, the prospect is interested, and suddenly you realize—none of this is in your CRM.

To log it, you have to stop chatting, open Pipedrive, create a new person, copy the phone number, copy the name, create a deal, and then copy-paste the important notes. By the time you're done, the momentum is gone, and you've wasted precious minutes on data entry.

It's no wonder so many WhatsApp leads never make it into Pipedrive. But "if it's not in the CRM, it didn't happen."

**Chat2Deal** solves this by bringing Pipedrive directly into WhatsApp Web. Instead of switching tabs, you get a dedicated sidebar that lets you capture leads, create deals, and save notes without ever leaving your conversation.

## The 30-Second Overview: What is Chat2Deal?

Chat2Deal is a lightweight Chrome extension that connects your WhatsApp Web account to Pipedrive.

Unlike complex automation tools that require business API verification or expensive shared inboxes, Chat2Deal works with your **existing WhatsApp account** (Personal or Business) and installs in seconds.

It detects who you are chatting with and instantly searches your Pipedrive database. If they exist, it shows their details and open deals. If they don't, it lets you add them as a contact with one click.

## Step 1: Install and Connect

Getting started takes less than a minute. We designed Chat2Deal to be "install and go."

1. **Install the Extension:** Add Chat2Deal to Chrome from the Web Store.
2. **Open WhatsApp Web:** Refresh your WhatsApp Web tab. You'll see a new sidebar appear on the right side of your screen.
3. **Sign In:** Click "Sign in with Pipedrive." This uses the official Pipedrive OAuth connection, so your credentials remain secure.

Once connected, the sidebar will immediately react to your current chat.

## Step 2: Create a New Contact from WhatsApp

Here is the most common scenario: a new lead messages you.

Usually, you'd have to copy their phone number and switch tabs. With Chat2Deal, the sidebar automatically detects that this phone number isn't in Pipedrive yet.

1. Open the chat with the new lead.
2. The sidebar displays a "Person not found" status.
3. Click **Create Person**.
4. The form auto-fills the **Name** (from their WhatsApp profile) and **Phone Number**.
5. Click **Save**.

That's it. The contact is now in Pipedrive. No copy-pasting required.

## Step 3: Attach a Number to an Existing Person

Sometimes you're chatting with someone you *know* is in your CRM, but maybe they're messaging from a new number or their personal phone.

Instead of creating a duplicate contact, use the **Link** feature:

1. In the sidebar, click the **"Link to existing"** tab (or "Attach to person").
2. Search for their name (e.g., "John Smith").
3. Select the correct profile from the results.
4. Click **Attach Phone**.

Chat2Deal updates their existing Pipedrive profile with this new WhatsApp number, keeping your data clean and unified.

## Bonus: Manage Deals Without Leaving WhatsApp

Capturing the contact is just step one. To really close sales, you need to manage the **Deal**.

Once a contact is synced, Chat2Deal shows you a "Deals" section right in the sidebar. You can:

- **See open deals:** Know immediately if this person is a cold lead or in the "Negotiation" stage.
- **Create a new deal:** Click "Add Deal," give it a title (like "Consultation - John"), and it's live in your pipeline.
- **Update stages:** Move a lead from "New" to "Contact Made" directly from the sidebar dropdown.

## Stop Losing Leads to "I'll Do It Later"

The friction of manual data entry costs sales teams millions in lost revenue because valuable context gets trapped in WhatsApp chats. By removing the friction, you ensure every lead is captured and every conversation is tracked.
