We’re excited about the potential to connect. Pipedrive is a global CRM with headquarters in the USA and operations in the USA and EU, featuring an intuitive [RESTful API](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/). You can use our API to create public or private apps using [OAuth 2.0](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization) and integrations via [API token](/docs/how-to-find-the-api-token). Public apps and integrations work directly with Pipedrive and are available in Pipedrive’s [Marketplace](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/marketplace).

🚦 Before you get started, you agree and attest that you do NOT have any developers or operations in any countries or locations sanctioned by applicable governmental authorities.  
🔴 This restricted countries/locations list can change, but as of July 28, 2025, it includes: Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Venezuela, and the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson Crimea regions of Ukraine.  
❓Questions - See Pipedrive Terms of Service Section 4.2 Trade Control Compliance for more information or consult your legal counsel.
