# Date format

[ __Suggest Edits](/edit/core-api-concepts-date-format)

All dates and times received by the API will be in ISO 8601 format `2019-01-22 08:55:59` (would be the same as `2019-01-22T08:55:59`).

The times that are sent to the API should also be converted to the UTC timezone before being sent.
