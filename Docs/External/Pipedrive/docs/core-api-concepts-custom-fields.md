# Custom fields

[ __Suggest Edits](/edit/core-api-concepts-custom-fields)

Custom fields allow you to add additional data to your Pipedrive account that isn't included by default. Each **deal** , **organization** , **person** , and **product** item can contain custom fields. We have [16 different field types](/docs/core-api-concepts-custom-fields#types-of-custom-fields) available, each with its own uses.

Creating a custom field

[](#creating-a-custom-field)

* * *

See our [creating a new custom field](https://developers.pipedrive.com/tutorials/add-custom-field-pipedrive-api) tutorial to add a custom field programmatically.

Method| URL| Useful for  
---|---|---  
`POST`| [`/dealFields`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/DealFields#addDealField)| Adding a new deal field.  
**NB!** Leads inherit all dealsâ€™ custom fields.  
`POST`| [`/organizationFields`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/OrganizationFields#addOrganizationField)| Adding a new organization field  
`POST`| [`/personFields`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/PersonFields#addPersonField)| Adding a new person field

Naming a custom field

[](#naming-a-custom-field)

* * *

All custom fields are referenced as randomly generated 40-character hashes in the dataset, for example, `dcf558aac1ae4e8c4f849ba5e668430d8df9be12` \- it may look like our office cat walked across the laptop, but this actually is a key for a custom field in our API dataset.

> ## ðŸš§
> 
> These 40-character custom fields (for example, `dcf558aac1ae4e8c4f849ba5e668430d8df9be12`) are not shown in our API Reference as they **differ for each Pipedrive account** , but they can be seen in the API requests and responses as well as used in the requests when adding new items or updating existing ones.

You canâ€™t rename the reference of the custom field (the field API key), but you can rename the `name` of a custom field thatâ€™s visible to the User.

Inside Pipedrive, you can find the API key of a field by going to _Settings > Data fields_ and choosing the entity (deal/person/organization/product). When you hover over the row of a custom field, a three-dot menu appears on the right-hand side. From there, choose _Copy API key_.

Referencing a custom field

[](#referencing-a-custom-field)

* * *

Hereâ€™s how you use an example key for a custom field in an example `POST` request to `/deals` (make sure you replace the example key with yours before making the request):

PHP
    
    
    <?php
    $api_token = 'Your API token goes here';
     
    $deal = array (
        'title' => 'New deal with a custom field',
        'value' => '500',
        'currency' => 'USD',
        'dcf558aac1ae4e8c4f849ba5e668430d8df9be12' => 'A new field value for an existing example custom field key'
    );
     
    $url = 'https://companydomain.pipedrive.com/api/v1/deals';
    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $deal);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['x-api-token: ' . $api_token]);
    
    $output = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
     
    $result = json_decode($output, true); // Check if an ID came back, if did print it out
     
    if (!empty($result['data']['id'])) { echo 'Deal was added successfully!' . PHP_EOL; }
    

Each custom field type corresponds to a specific data format. To determine in which format you need to submit data into a custom field, make a `GET` request for the same kind of object and check the format of the value of that field. You can find the list of `field_type` in [the table](/docs/core-api-concepts-custom-fields#types-of-custom-fields) below.

Updating a custom field

[](#updating-a-custom-field)

> ## ðŸš§
> 
> We don't recommend deleting a custom field, because it might permanently remove all data. In case you do delete by mistake, there's a chance that you can get it back by [contacting](https://support.pipedrive.com/en/contact-us) our awesome support people.

See our [deleting a custom field](https://developers.pipedrive.com/tutorials/delete-custom-field-pipedrive-api) tutorial to delete a custom field programmatically.

Method| URL| Useful for  
---|---|---  
`DELETE`| [`/dealFields/{id}`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/DealFields#deleteDealField)| Marking a deal field as deleted.  
**NB!** Leads inherit all deals' custom fields.  
`DELETE`| [`/organizationFields/{id}`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/OrganizationFields#deleteOrganizationField)| Marking an organization field as deleted  
`DELETE`| [`/personFields/{id}`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/PersonFields#deletePersonField)| Marking a person field as deleted  
`DELETE`| [`/productFields/{id}`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/ProductFields#deleteProductField)| Marking a product field as deleted  
  
After a custom field is deleted, it will no longer appear in API responses. All `POST` requests mentioning a custom field will ignore it.

Types of custom fields

[](#types-of-custom-fields)

* * *

See below the 16 different types of custom fields available:

How to find out if a field is a custom field

[](#how-to-find-out-if-a-field-is-a-custom-field)

* * *

The `edit_flag` parameter in the response body of an entityâ€™s fields can be used to identify if the field is a custom field:

  * `true` â€“ a custom field
  * `false` â€“ Pipedrive default field



JSON
    
    
    {
      id: 12499,
      key: '123456789',
      name: 'Date',
      order_nr: 47,
      field_type: 'date',
      json_column_flag: true,
      add_time: '2023-03-02 02:14:54',
      update_time: '2023-03-02 02:14:54',
      last_updated_by_user_id: 13053568,
      edit_flag: true,
      details_visible_flag: true,
      add_visible_flag: false,
      important_flag: true,
      bulk_edit_allowed: true,

Custom fields created by Contact Sync

[](#custom-fields-created-by-contact-sync)

* * *

When a user first sets up Contact Sync, five new custom fields (Instant messenger, Postal address, Notes, Birthday, Job title) are created for the entire company. These fields are similar to the default Pipedrive fields as they have a field API key that follows the syntax of all default Pipedrive API keys (field name, with an underscore replacing each space), unlike [user-generated custom fields](/docs/core-api-concepts-custom-fields#naming-a-custom-field). 

Here are the five custom fields created by Contact Sync:

Field name| Type| Show in Add new dialog| Show in detail view| Field API key| Additional info  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Instant messenger| Varchar|  _by default:_ No|  _by default:_ No| `im`| Although this is a text field, it accepts an array of objects. ([See example below](/docs/core-api-concepts-custom-fields#instant-messenger-field-and-labels))  
Postal address| Address|  _by default:_ No|  _by default:_ No| `postal_address`|   
Notes| Large Text|  _by default:_ No|  _by default:_ No| `notes`|   
Birthday| Date|  _by default:_ No|  _by default:_ No| `birthday`|   
Job title| Text|  _by default:_ No|  _by default:_ No| `job_title`|   
  
You can also see these fields in the Pipedrive web app by going to _Settings > (Company) > Data fields > Person_. Itâ€™s not possible to add any other fields to Contact Sync.

Contact Sync and custom fields duplication

[](#contact-sync-and-custom-fields-duplication)

Contact Sync directly affects these five fields, as the data for these fields is updated every time the Contact Sync source is updated. As such, when using these fields, please note that they may be duplicated by users who create custom fields with the same name. This can cause issues where the field names match, but the API keys do not because one has a Pipedrive API key and the other has a [40-character hashed API key](/docs/core-api-concepts-custom-fields#naming-a-custom-field). Therefore, a user may have two fields with different information in them.

#### 

Instant messenger field and labels

[](#instant-messenger-field-and-labels)

The instant messenger field (field key `im`) is a text field that accepts an array of objects. Do note that multiple `labels `are available for the different instant messengers, for example, `Google`, `AIM`, `Yahoo`, `Skype`, etc.

Here is an example of what an array for this field could look like:

JSON
    
    
    [
      {
        "label": "google",
        "value": "[[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
        "primary": true
      },
      {
        "label": "aim",
        "value": "[[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
        "primary": false
      }
    ]
