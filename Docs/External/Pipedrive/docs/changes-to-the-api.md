Changes to the Pipedrive API can be divided into breaking and non-breaking changes.

A **breaking change** is a backward incompatible change that may require updating your app.  
A **non-breaking change** is typically a new addition to the API that can be implemented at your own pace and choosing.

> ## ðŸš§
> 
> We aim to announce **breaking changes** via our [Changelog](https://developers.pipedrive.com/changelog) at least **60 days** in advance to give you adequate time to adopt the changes.
