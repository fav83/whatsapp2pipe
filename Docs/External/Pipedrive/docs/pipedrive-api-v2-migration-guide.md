Migration Guide

[](#migration-guide)

This document outlines the differences between Pipedrive API v1 and v2 of endpoints which are available on v2. Where available, please use API v2 for the best performance and developer experience.

## 

General API Changes

[](#general-api-changes)

  * All v2 endpoints now have significantly stricter input validation to improve data quality and prevent ambiguity. 
    * Any boolean value fields which returned or accepted `1` or `0` now only return and accept `true` and `false` respectively.
    * Numeric fields no longer coerce string input to number and instead throw a validation error.
  * Related objects have been removed from API responses to prevent too eager fetching of unnecessary data. Use subsequent API calls to fetch them if you still need them.
  * All timestamps in the v2 API are now in RFC 3339 format (e.g. `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z` or `2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`) unless specified otherwise to ensure clarity regarding timezones.
  * Support for [field selectors](/docs/core-api-concepts-requests#field-selector) has been removed.
  * V1 endpoints, which were using HTTP PUT method have been switched to use HTTP PATCH method in v2 for compliance with REST best practices.
  * Only `/api/v2/...` prefix is supported. Previously both `/api/v1/...` and `/v1/...` could be used.



### 

Custom Fields

[](#custom-fields)

Entity custom fields have been moved to a separate `custom_fields` object with clearer syntax.

Previously custom fields were on the root level of the entity object and had separate keys for their subfields. For example, a currency custom field in API v1 was presented as

JSON
    
    
    "d4de1c1518b4531717c676029a45911c340390a6": 2300,
    "d4de1c1518b4531717c676029a45911c340390a6_currency": "EUR"
    

The same field is now presented in API v2 as

JSON
    
    
    "custom_fields": {
      ...,
      "d4de1c1518b4531717c676029a45911c340390a6": {
      "value": 2300,
      "currency": "EUR"
    },
    ...
    }
    

See subsections below for the exact changes for each custom field type.

Time Custom Field Format Changes

[](#time-custom-field-format-changes)

Optionally `timezone_name` can be provided when setting the custom field value. Valid values are Time Zone identifiers from the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). `timezone_id` can also be used to set the time zone, however there is no API to map these time zone IDs to actual time zone names and support for setting `timezone_id` might be discontinued in the future. If `timezone_id` and `timezone_name` are not specified, the current user's time zone is used.

### 

Pagination

[](#pagination)

Offset based pagination (`start` & `limit`) has been replaced with cursor based pagination (`cursor` & `limit`), which makes iterating over large collections significantly faster. See [Pagination](/docs/core-api-concepts-pagination#cursor-pagination) for more information.

### 

Sorting

[](#sorting)

Endpoints, which support sorting, now have 2 optional parameters (`sort_by` and `sort_direction`) instead of 1 (`sort`).  
\- `sort_by` accepted values: `id`, `add_time`, `update_time` plus a few additional fields depending on the entity. Defaults to `id`.  
\- `sort_direction` accepted values: `asc`, `desc`. Defaults to `asc`.

A maximum of 1 field to sort by can be provided.

Changes Summary

[](#changes-summary)

_Please note that this section does not include the changes already covered in[General API Changes](#general-api-changes) section._

  * `first_char` and `files_count` fields are no longer included
  * `visible_to` field type has changed from string to integer. Old possible values were `"1"`, `"3"`, `"5"`, `"7"`. New possible values are `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`.
  * `selectable` field has been renamed to `is_linkable` for clarity. When set to `true`, the product is linkable to deals.
  * `active_flag` field has been replaced with `is_deleted`. It is the negation of the old value. When an entity has `is_deleted` set to true, the entity is considered soft deleted and will be fully deleted after 30 days of last activity.
  * `product_variations` has been removed to a separate Product Variations API described below.

Changes Summary

[](#changes-summary-2)

_Please note that this section does not include the changes already covered in[General API Changes](#general-api-changes) section._

Previously product variations were returned as part of the main products API. They have now been moved to a separate API with the following endpoints:

  * `GET /api/v2/products/:id/variations`
  * `POST /api/v2/products/:id/variations`
  * `PATCH /api/v2/products/:id/variations/:id`
  * `DELETE /api/v2/products/:id/variations/:id`



The `prices` object no longer includes the following fields: `id`, `product_id`, `comment` and `price_formatted`.

Only change is a switch to cursor based pagination (`cursor` and `limit` instead of `start` and `limit`). See [Pagination](/docs/core-api-concepts-pagination#cursor-pagination) for more information.

### 

GET /api/v1/itemSearch/field to GET /api/v2/itemSearch/field

[](#get-apiv1itemsearchfield-to-get-apiv2itemsearchfield)

  * The endpoint now uses cursor based pagination. See [Pagination](/docs/core-api-concepts-pagination#cursor-pagination) for more information.
  * `field_key` parameter has been renamed to `field`.
  * `field_type` parameter has been renamed to `entity_type`.
  * `entity_type` accepted values have been simplified to just `deal`, `lead` , `person`, `organization`, `product`, `project` from previous `dealField`, `leadField` etc.
  * `return_item_ids` parameter has been removed, the response always includes item ids now.
  * `exact_match` boolean parameter has been replaced with a string `match` parameter. Accepted values are 
    * `exact` \- fastest. Matches only if the field value is exactly the same as the `term`.
    * `beginning` \- fast. Matches fields by beginning, e.g. finds `my field value` with `my fie`
    * `middle` \- slowest. Old default behaviour. Matches fields by any substring, e.g. finds `my field value` with `ld va`. We recommend using other types of matching where possible for best experience.

Changes Summary

[](#changes-summary-3)

_Please note that this section does not include the changes already covered in[General API Changes](#general-api-changes) section._

  * `url_title` field is no longer included.
  * `selected` field has been renamed to `is_selected` for clarity. When set to `true`, the product is linkable to deals.
  * `active_flag` field has been replaced with `is_deleted`. It is the negation of the old value. When an entity has `is_deleted` set to true, the entity is considered soft deleted and will be fully deleted after 30 days of last activity.
  * `order_nr` is now read-only. When creating a new pipeline, it is placed at the end of existing Pipelines list. If user wants, they can reorder pipelines in the UI.

Changes Summary

_Please note that this section does not include the changes already covered in[General API Changes](#general-api-changes) section._

  * `creator_user_id`, `user_id`, `person_id` and `org_id`fields no longer contain an object but the relevant id.
  * `user_id` field has been renamed to `owner_id` for clarity and consistency with other entities.
  * `deleted` boolean field has been renamed to `is_deleted`. This is so all entities have a consistently named field for deleted status. When an entity has `is_deleted` set to true, the entity is considered soft deleted and will be fully deleted after 30 days of last activity.
  * The following fields are only included in the response when providing these field keys as comma separated string using the `include_fields` querystring parameter: `next_activity_id`, `last_activity_id`, `first_won_time`, `products_count`, `files_count`, `notes_count`, `followers_count`, `email_messages_count`, `activities_count`, `done_activities_count`, `undone_activities_count` , `participants_count`, `last_incoming_mail_time`, `last_outgoing_mail_time`, `smart_bcc_email`.
  * `label` field has been replaced with `label_ids` field. Old field value was a comma concatenated string of label ids (e.g. `"3,7"`, new value is an array of ids (e.g. `[3, 7]`).
  * `visible_to`field type has changed from string to integer. Old possible values were`"1"`, `"3"`, `"5"`, `"7"`. New possible values are `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`.
  * `active` boolean field has been removed. It represented the condition `status == 'open'` which can be used directly instead.
  * `weighted_value`´has been removed. The value can be derived as `value * probability/100`.
  * `next_activity_date`, `next_activity_time`, `next_activity_subject`, `next_activity_type`, `next_activity_duration`, `next_activity_note` have been removed. They can be fetched via activities API using the optional field `next_activity_id`.
  * `last_activity_date` has been removed. It can be fetched via activities API using the optional field `last_activity_id`.
  * `owner_name`, `person_name`, `org_name`, `org_hidden` and `person_hidden` fields have been removed. They can be fetched via relevant APIs using the relevant id fields.
  * `formatted_value`, `formatted_weighted_value`, `stage_order_nr` fields have been removed.
  * Statistics fields `average_time_to_won`, `average_stage_progress` and `stay_in_pipeline_stages` have been removed.
  * `acv_currency`, `arr_currency` and `mrr_currency` fields have been removed. Their value was always equivalent to the value of `currency`.
  * `cc_email` field has been renamed to `smart_bcc_email` and is only included if `include_fields=smart_bcc_email` query parameter is used.

Changes Summary

[](#changes-summary-6)

_Please note that this section does not include the changes already covered in[General API Changes](#general-api-changes) section._

  * `picture_id`, `owner_id`, and `org_id`fields no longer contain an object but the relevant id.
  * `is_active` boolean field has been renamed to `is_deleted` and the old value negated. This is so all entities have a consistently named field for deleted status. When an entity has `is_deleted` set to true, the entity is considered soft deleted and will be fully deleted after 30 days of last activity.
  * The following fields are only included in the response when providing these field keys as comma separated string using the `include_fields` querystring parameter: `next_activity_id`, `last_activity_id`, `open_deals_count`, `related_open_deals_count`, `closed_deals_count`, `related_closed_deals_count`, `participant_open_deals_count`, `participant_closed_deals_count`, `email_messages_count`, `activities_count`, `done_activities_count`, `undone_activities_count` , `files_count`, `notes_count`, `followers_count`, `won_deals_count`, `related_won_deals_count`, `lost_deals_count`, `related_lost_deals_count`, `last_incoming_mail_time`, `last_outgoing_mail_time`, `marketing_status`, `doi_status`.
  * `label` field has been replaced with `label_ids` field. Old field value was a comma concatenated string of label ids (e.g. `"3,7"`, new value is an array of ids (e.g. `[3, 7]`).
  * `visible_to`field type has changed from string to integer. Old possible values were`"1"`, `"3"`, `"5"`, `"7"`. New possible values are `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`.
  * `next_activity_date` and `next_activity_time` have been removed. They can be fetched via activities API using the optional field `next_activity_id`.
  * `last_activity_date` has been removed. It can be fetched via activities API using the optional field `last_activity_id`.
  * `owner_name` and `org_name` fields have been removed. They can be fetched via relevant APIs using the relevant id fields.
  * `delete_time` field has been removed. If the person has `is_deleted: true`, `update_time` is the `delete_time`.
  * `company_id` and `first_char` fields have been removed.
  * `phone`, `email` and `im` fields have been renamed to `phones`, `emails` and `ims` as they contain multiple elements.
  * Fields `job_title`, `notes`, `birthday`, `postal_address` and `ims` are only included if the company has contact sync feature enabled. 
    * `postal_address` is now formatted as an object like an `address` type custom field instead of being spread across multiple fields. See [General API Changes](#general-api-changes) for more info.

Changes Summary

[](#changes-summary-7)

_Please note that this section does not include the changes already covered in[General API Changes](#general-api-changes) section._

  * `owner_id` field no longer contain an object but the relevant user id.
  * `is_active` boolean field has been renamed to `is_deleted` and the old value negated. This is so all entities have a consistently named field for deleted status. When an entity has `is_deleted` set to true, the entity is considered soft deleted and will be fully deleted after 30 days of last activity.
  * The following fields are only included in the response when providing these field keys as comma separated string using the `include_fields` querystring parameter: `next_activity_id`, `last_activity_id`, `open_deals_count`, `related_open_deals_count`, `closed_deals_count`, `related_closed_deals_count`, `participant_open_deals_count`, `participant_closed_deals_count`, `email_messages_count`, `activities_count`, `done_activities_count`, `undone_activities_count` , `files_count`, `notes_count`, `followers_count`, `won_deals_count`, `related_won_deals_count`, `lost_deals_count`, `related_lost_deals_count`, `last_incoming_mail_time`, `last_outgoing_mail_time`, `marketing_status`, `doi_status`.
  * `label` field has been replaced with `label_ids` field. Old field value was a comma concatenated string of label ids (e.g. `"3,7"`, new value is an array of ids (e.g. `[3, 7]`).
  * `visible_to`field type has changed from string to integer. Old possible values were`"1"`, `"3"`, `"5"`, `"7"`. New possible values are `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`.
  * `next_activity_date` and `next_activity_time` have been removed. They can be fetched via activities API using the optional field `next_activity_id`.
  * `last_activity` and `next_activity` objects have been removed.
  * `last_activity_date` has been removed. It can be fetched via activities API using the optional field `last_activity_id`.
  * `owner_name` field has been removed. It can be fetched via users API using `owner_id` field.
  * `delete_time` field has been removed. If the organization has `is_deleted: true`, `update_time` is the `delete_time`.
  * `company_id`, `category_id`, `edit_name`, `country_code` and `first_char` fields have been removed.
  * `address` is now formatted as an object like an `address` type custom field instead of being spread across multiple fields. See [General API Changes](#general-api-changes) for more info.

Changes Summary

When an entity has `is_deleted` set to true, the entity is considered soft deleted and will be fully deleted after 30 days of last activity.
  * The following fields are only included in the response when providing these field keys as comma separated string using the `include_fields` querystring parameter: `attendees`.
  * `deal_title`, `lead_title`, `project_title`, `person_name`, `org_name`, `owner_name`, `type_name`,`person_dropbox_bcc`, `deal_dropbox_bcc` fields have been removed. They can be fetched via relevant APIs using the relevant id fields.
  * `busy_flag` has been renamed to `busy`.
  * `marked_as_done_time` defaults to `null` instead of an empty string if the activity not marked as done.
  * `delete_time` field has been removed. If the person has `is_deleted: true`, `update_time` is the `delete_time`.
  * `created_by_user_id` field has been renamed to `creator_user_id` for consistency with other APIs.
  * `assigned_to_user_id` field has been removed. It always had the same value as `user_id` field (which has now been renamed to `owner_id`).
  * `company_id`, `last_notification_time`, `last_notification_user_id`, `notification_language_id`, `calendar_sync_include_context` , `person_dropbox_bcc`, `deal_dropbox_bcc`, `type_name`, `reference_type`, `reference_id`, `conference_meeting_client`, `conference_meeting_url`, `conference_meeting_id`, `series`, `is_recurring`, `rec_rule`, `rec_rule_extension`, `rec_master_activity_id`, `original_start_time`, `source_timezone`, `update_user_id` fields have been removed as they are for internal use only.
  * `location` is now formatted as an object like an`address` type custom field instead of being spread across multiple fields. See [General API Changes](#general-api-changes) for more info.
