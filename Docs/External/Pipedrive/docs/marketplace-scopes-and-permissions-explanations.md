# Scopes and permission explanations

[ __Suggest Edits](/edit/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations)

Every time you create an app for the Pipedrive Marketplace, you'll need to determine what kind of user-related data you need access to. We use scopes for that.

**Scopes** are used to limit an app's access to user-related data and they'll let you specify exactly what kind of access you need.

On the other hand, it's also important for the user to know exactly what the app can and cannot do with the data in their Pipedrive account. Once a user permits access to their data, each scope will define the endpoints the app has access to. 

> ## üöß
> 
> The user has the option to **either accept or deny all scopes**. Because of this, it's a good idea to **build apps that only request scopes that are absolutely necessary** for your particular use case.

> ## üìò
> 
> If you need to **change the scopes** of an already existing app, be sure to read more about how it can affect your app's users [here](/docs/marketplace-updating-the-existing-app#changing-the-scopes).

Permission set effect on admin scope

[](#permission-set-effect-on-admin-scope)

* * *

The admin scope requires the user who is installing an app (from the Pipedrive's Marketplace), to have admin rights within the company. As the Marketplace doesn't restrict non-admin users from installing apps, your app will need to be able to handle users without admin rights installing the app, when the admin scope is required.

When your app requests admin scope access, the app will need to check if it can complete all of the required functionalities/actions through a non-admin user or whether those actions would require the permissions of an Admin. If the request fails, check to see if the user is a non-admin user and/or falls under a certain permission set or a visibility group. You can check that through the [`GET /users/{id}/permissions`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Users#getUserPermissions) endpoint. For additional information about user restrictions, you can see the list role settings - [`GET /users/{id}/roleSettings`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Users#getUserRoleSettings) and the list user role assignments - [`GET /users/{id}/roleAssignments`](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Users#getUserRoleAssignments). 

If an admin has installed the app before any regular user, your app may work correctly for non-admin users. Example use-case: 

_Your app needs to create activities with a custom activity type. An admin user of a company has installed the app and the custom activity type has been created for their company. Now, when a regular user who's a part of the same company installs the app, your app will be able to create the activities with before created activity type._

Affected use-cases can include your **app creating, editing or deleting activity types, stages and pipelines as well as custom fields**.
