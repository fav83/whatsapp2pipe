# Pipedrive API v2 overview

[ __Suggest Edits](/edit/pipedrive-api-v2)

Pipedriveâ€™s v1 API has been constantly evolving, but it is still based on the same foundations that were laid a long time ago. Pipedrive as a company has grown a lot since then and it is time to reflect that in our API as well. Hence, we are announcing a gradual transition to a new v2 version of our API.

The new v2 API comes with many benefits such as

  * a lot less breaking changes;
  * lower [rate limiter token costs](/docs/core-api-concepts-rate-limiting#token-based-rate-limiting) per endpoint;
  * significantly better performance and response times, especially when iterating over large data sets;
  * consistent and predictable behavior with compliance with REST best practices;
  * better data quality due to stricter input validation.



## 

What is changing?

[](#what-is-changing)

We will gradually release new v2 APIs to replace the corresponding parts of v1 API. The corresponding v1 APIs will then be marked for deprecation and have a grace period of at least 1 year for migrations.
