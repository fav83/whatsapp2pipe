If you don't see _API_ next to the _Your companies_ section (image below), it's due to the permission sets handled by the company's admin. The company's admin [can give you access](/docs/enabling-api-for-company-users#if-youre-an-admin) to your API token by enabling it for you from the _Settings_ in Pipedrive web app.

You can limit the API usage by disabling or enabling it to the users in your company. You can enable the API usage for the user by first going to the _Settings_ in Pipedrive web app:

And follow these steps:

  1. Click _Manage users_ from the left-side menu.
  2. Click on the _Permission sets_ tab.
  3. Choose the set where the user (who needs the API enabled) belongs to.
  4. Lastly, click on "use API" on the right-hand side section (you need to scroll down a bit). Now all users who belong in the set that has the API enabled can find their API token under _Settings > Personal Preferences > API_ in their Pipedrive web app.
