# Registering a private app

[ __Suggest Edits](/edit/marketplace-registering-a-private-app)

Private apps, aka internal apps, enable you to share your integration with any user/company in Pipedrive via a direct, unlisted installation link. To do so, you must fill out the parts of the app registration form that cover app creation and [make your private app live](/docs/marketplace-registering-a-private-app#how-to-share-your-private-app).

> NB: Do pick your app type carefully, as it cannot be changed later on Developer Hub.

To register a new app, click on the green ‚ÄúCreate an app‚Äù button (or ‚Äú+ Create an app‚Äù if you have existing apps) followed by ‚ÄúCreate private app‚Äù. This is also where you‚Äôd see a list of your public and private apps if you have any.

App registration form

[](#app-registration-form)

* * *

The app registration form for private apps contains three different tabs.

You can save your app anytime by clicking the green ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button and exiting the form by clicking the white ‚ÄúClose app settings‚Äù button. This will take you back to your Developer Hub dashboard.

Read on to find out how and what to fill in each tab.

### 

Basic info

[](#basic-info)

![Developer Hub > private apps - basic info](https://files.readme.io/0417bd8-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_Basic_info.png)

This tab has two required fields ‚Äì App name and OAuth Callback URL. Once you‚Äôve filled this in, click the green ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button to save the form. You‚Äôll then be brought to the second tab, ‚ÄúOAuth & access scopes‚Äù, where you‚Äôll get your `client_id` and `client_secret` and the option to make your app live via the ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù button.

Field| Description  
---|---  
App name (required)| Insert your app‚Äôs name by what it‚Äôs going to be recognized by in the Marketplace.  
  
_Example: Car Services App_  
Callback URL (required, one URL per app)| Insert a link where an authorization code will be sent if the user approves or declines the installation of your app. This link is also where we return the user after successful authentication. Technically, a callback URL is the same thing as an OAuth `redirect_uri`.  
  
It‚Äôs okay to insert a non-functioning URL when creating a new app as long as you can update this field with a proper URL after implementing the logic needed to accept user authorization in your code. Please keep in mind that we allow only one callback URL per app.  
  
_Example:<https://www.carservicesapp.com/API/v2/callback>_  
  
### 

OAuth & Access scopes

[](#oauth--access-scopes)

![Developer Hub > private apps - OAuth & access scopes](https://files.readme.io/a08a6fd-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_OAuth__access_scopes.png)

Field| Description  
---|---  
Access scopes (required)| Using [scopes](/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations), you can specify precisely what data access your application needs. Your selection will depend significantly on the endpoints you use in your app. You can also select the respective scope in this section if you are building a [manifest-based app extension](/docs/app-extensions#manifest-based-app-extensions).  
  
_Example:_  
‚úÖ _Read users data_  
‚úÖ _See recent account activity_  
Installation URL| This is where you can add an optional URL to which users will be redirected when using your direct [installation link](/docs/marketplace-registering-a-private-app#get-your-installation-link).  
  
Use it when you need to start [app authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization#step-1-requesting-authorization) outside of Pipedrive, redirect users to a custom landing page, or implement the [state parameter](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization-state-parameter) for additional security.  
Client ID| This is where you will get your app‚Äôs unique `client_id` and `client_secret` for [OAuth authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization).  
  
> ## üëç
> 
> Once you‚Äôve completed filling up the Basic info and OAuth & access scopes, we advise you to **start installing your app and testing it** to see how it works. You can do so by clicking on the green ‚ÄúInstall & test‚Äù button in the bottom left of the tab.

### 

App extensions

[](#app-extensions)

![Developer Hub - private apps > app extensions](https://files.readme.io/d82718a-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_App_extensions.png)

App extensions let you extend Pipedrive‚Äôs user interface with your app‚Äôs functionality and content to let users do more in one place. Find out more about them [here](/docs/app-extensions).

Within Developer Hub, the App extensions tab is where you can add new app extensions and manage the ones you‚Äôve added before. A modal with an app extension creation form will open when you click the button to add the respective app extension.

You can also make your app live via this tab's ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù button.

Install and test your draft app

[](#install-and-test-your-draft-app)

* * *

Installing and testing your draft app is an important step before making your private app live. It enables you to ensure everything in your app runs smoothly and identify and address potential issues early on.

NB: app testing only works for users in your sandbox account and cannot be shared with external users.

To install and test your app, click the ‚ÄúInstall and test‚Äù notification above your app‚Äôs name or the ‚ÄúInstall & test‚Äù option from the three-dot menu.

![Developer Hub > private app - install & test](https://files.readme.io/d219bae-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_install_and_test.png)

You can also click the green ‚ÄúInstall & test‚Äù button at the bottom left of the OAuth & access scopes and App extensions tabs.

![Developer Hub > private app - install & test from the OAuth & access scopes tab](https://files.readme.io/441903e-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_Install__test_-_OAuth__access_scopes.png)

You will then be brought to the OAuth confirmation dialog where you can allow and install your app to begin testing it.

How to share your private app

[](#how-to-share-your-private-app)

* * *

There are two steps to sharing your private app with any user/company in Pipedrive:

  1. Make your private app live
  2. Get your installation link



### 

Make your private app live

[](#make-your-private-app-live)

You have to make your private app live before you can share it. You can do this by clicking the ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù button in the app registration form or the ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù option in the three-dot menu next to your private app‚Äôs name.

As we will validate your callback URL when you click ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù, please **ensure your OAuth callback URL is a functioning one**.

Note that live private apps cannot be reverted to draft status. Any changes you make to your live private app will be immediately available for all users once you click ‚ÄòSave‚Äô.

**Change to live ‚Äì app registration form**

_For new private apps_

![Developer Hub > private app - new app "change to live"](https://files.readme.io/bc39c67-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_OAuth__access_scopes.png)

After you fill in your app name and callback URL in the Basic info tab and click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù, you will be brought to the OAuth & access scopes with the ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù button enabled. Once the ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù button is enabled, you can make your private app live anytime by clicking on it in any tab.  
  


_For draft private apps_

![Developer Hub > private app - draft app "change to live"](https://files.readme.io/17ca8c3-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_draft_app_change_to_live.png)

The ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù button will be enabled once you open your draft private app, as you‚Äôve previously filled in and saved your app name and callback URL. You can make your private app live anytime by clicking ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù in any tab of the app registration form.

**Change to live ‚Äì three-dot menu**

![Private app - three-dot menu](https://files.readme.io/cb939b5-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_three-dot_menu.png)

When you click on the three-dot menu next to your private app‚Äôs name, you will find the ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù option. Clicking on this will take you to the Basic info tab of your private app, where you must click ‚ÄúChange to live‚Äù again to share your app.

### 

Get your installation link

[](#get-your-installation-link)

Once your private app is live, you can share it via its installation link. The installation link can be found in the three-dot menu next to your private app‚Äôs name in your Developer Hub dashboard.

![Developer Hub > private app - share install link](https://files.readme.io/bdd07b8-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_share_private_app.png)

You can also find the installation link through the ‚ÄúShare app‚Äù button at the bottom left of your app‚Äôs OAuth & access scopes tab.

![Developer Hub > private app - share install link from OAuth & access scopes tab](https://files.readme.io/4dac119-Developer_Hub_-_Private_app_-_Install__test_-_OAuth__access_scopes.png)

* * *

## 

App status

[](#app-status)

* * *

![Developer Hub - apps list](https://files.readme.io/f18a664-Developer_Hub_dashboard_-_apps_list.png)

Private apps can have two statuses:

App status| Description  
---|---  
![App status - draft](https://files.readme.io/919b4df-Developer_Hub_-_app_status_-_draft.png)| Your app is in a draft state. It can be shared with users in the same Pipedrive company.  
![App status - draft](https://files.readme.io/fd32e40-Developer_Hub_-_private_app_status_-_live.png)| Your app is live and can be shared with any company in Pipedrive via its direct, unlisted installation link.
