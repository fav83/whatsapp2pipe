## 

What is Invoicing app extension?

[](#what-is-invoicing-app-extension)

Apps that provide an invoicing capability can now display their contents right inside Pipedrive, allowing them to:

  1. Create invoices from within the deal detail view and also see, send by email, download and approve invoices directly from the flow item. Once the app is installed, users can view and add necessary information about an invoice both directly from and to the installed invoicing app.

  3. Link a person or organization to an app extension contact

![2526](https://files.readme.io/5b7f456-invoicing_app_extension_modal2.png)

Clicking on the icon on the right of the contact allows users to link/unlink a person or an organization with a provider contact, making it possible to invoice customers directly from within Pipedrive

  4. Show contextual information about a person or organization value through an invoicing panel

Development process

[](#development-process)

* * *

To extend your appâ€™s capabilities to the invoice tab and invoice panel in Pipedrive, weâ€™ve built a logic of reverse APIs, where Pipedrive will request information from the invoicing serviceâ€™s API. These requests will be made to endpoints that are defined in a [manifest](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#manifest-for-invoicing-app-extension) uploaded to the [Developer Hub](/docs/marketplace-registering-the-app#app-extensions) by the app creator.

### 

Steps to take

[](#steps-to-take)

To begin, youâ€™ll need access to the [Developer Hub](https://app.pipedrive.com/developer-hub), where your app is maintained.

Next, the app must utilize [OAuth 2.0](/docs/marketplace-oauth-api) and enable the invoice integration scope.

  * For more info on how to connect an app to Pipedrive or to third party services when the app acts as an intermediary, see [connecting the app](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#connecting-the-app)



Once the tokens necessary for OAuth 2.0 are stored, you should get acquainted with how to add the manifest.

  


* * *

## 

Manifest for invoicing app extension

[](#manifest-for-invoicing-app-extension)

* * *

The manifest describes, in a special contract format, the endpoints which Pipedrive API makes requests to. Based on the responses of those requests, the invoicing information will display inside Pipedrive. The data will be displayed in a pre-defined format which you can see at [the top of this page](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#what-is-invoicing-app-extension).

The manifest for your app will need the appropriate URLs of invoicing serviceâ€™s endpoints. Once the manifest for your invoicing app is submitted to Developer Hub, it will be validated against a pre-defined schema.

### 

Template for invoicing manifest

[](#template-for-invoicing-manifest)

The file below defines the JSON schema for an app that wants to display its contents inside the Pipedrive invoice tab through the manifest.

This is a sample of the manifest youâ€™d need to submit for the Invoicing app extension. For your own manifest, just add your values for `clientID`, `endpoints`, and `templates` (if theyâ€™re being used). For a detailed explanation, see [the explanations table](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#explanation-of-the-manifest).

JSON
    
    
    {
      "version": "v202101",
      "clientId": "dummyclientid123",
      "features": {
        "templates": true
      },
      "endpoints": {
        "getAccounts": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/invoice-accounts",
        "getContact": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/contacts/:contactId",
        "getCurrencies": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/currencies",
        "getInvoicePDF": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/invoices/:invoiceId/download",
        "getInvoiceShareUrl": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/invoices/:invoiceId/share",
        "getInvoiceSummary": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/report/invoice-summary",
        "getProduct": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/products/:productId",
        "getProviderAccount": "https://www.example.com/:linkId",
        "getProviderAccountConnectUrl": "https://www.example.com/users/:linkId/auth",
        "getSearchContacts": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/contacts",
        "getSearchInvoices": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/invoices",
        "getSearchProducts": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/products",
        "getTaxRates": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/tax-rates",
        "getTemplates": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/invoice-templates",
        "postContact": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/contacts",
        "postInvoice": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/invoices",
        "postInvoiceEmail": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/invoices/:invoiceId/email",
        "postInvoiceStatus": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/invoices/:invoiceId/action",
        "postProduct": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/products",
        "putContact": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/contacts/:contactId",
        "putProduct": "https://www.example.com/:linkId/products/:productId"
      }
    }
    

### 

Manifest URL format

[](#manifest-url-format)

All endpointsâ€™ values in the manifest must be provided as strings. We support the following parameters in the URL strings, which will be replaced. 

  * `linkId` will be replaced with the unique identifier the vendor [registers the connection with](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#finalizing-the-connection) with that represents the connection between the app and the user. `linkId` must be in all endpoints' URLs.

  * `invoiceId` will be replaced by the unique identifier of the Invoice that is returned in `getInvoice` endpoint. `invoiceId` must be provided in the URLs of [`postInvoiceStatus`](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#post-invoice-status) , [`postInvoiceEmail`](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#post-invoice-email), [`getInvoiceShareUrl`](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#get-invoice-share-url), and [`getInvoicePDF`](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#get-invoice-pdf).

  * `contactId` will be replaced with the unique identifier of a contact that is returned via contact methods like [`postContact`](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#post-contact) and [`getSearchContacts`](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#get-search-contacts).

  * `productId` will be replaced with the unique identifier of a product that is returned via product methods like [`postProduct`](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#post-products) and [`getSearchProducts`](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#get-search-products).




A valid URL would be `"https://www.example.com/:linkId/invoicePDF/:invoiceId"` where `linkId` is the unique identifier of the connection and `invoiceId` unique identifier of the invoice.

### 

Explanation of the manifest

[](#explanation-of-the-manifest)

The invoicing app extensionâ€™s manifest describes the following object (see table).

Connecting the app

[](#connecting-the-app)

* * *

### 

Connecting the app to Pipedrive

[](#connecting-the-app-to-pipedrive)

The application is installed by clicking install in the Pipedrive Marketplace. Once the user has agreed to the [scopes](/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations), the browser gets redirected to the appâ€™s registered `callback URL` ([step 3 of OAuth authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization#step-3-callback-to-your-app)).

At this moment, the app needs to fetch and permanently store the OAuth tokens it receives from Pipedrive ([step 4 of the OAuth authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization#step-4-and-step-5-getting-the-tokens)). For invoicing apps, we require generating a unique identifier string (for example, a `UUID`) for each connection/link, which will be used by Pipedrive for all API calls executed against the app (also see [finalizing the connection](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#finalizing-the-connection)).

### 

Connecting the app to an invoicing provider

[](#connecting-the-app-to-an-invoicing-provider)

If the app is an intermediate between a service provider, it needs to authenticate against the provider according to that service specification. Youâ€™ll likely need to authenticate against their OAuth and store the required tokens **along with** Pipedrive tokens.

### 

Finalizing the connection

[](#finalizing-the-connection)

After the unique identifier has been generated and the OAuth tokens stored, the app needs to register itself as a data provider by calling the Pipedrive API `https://{COMPANYDOMAIN}.pipedrive.com/api/v1/invoice/user/provider` with `RegisterProviderLink` payload and using `Authorization: Bearer <access_token> ` header. 

To finalize everything, the app should redirect the user to the `redirectUrl` that was received as the response for the registration call against Pipedrive API. On that page, the user will see if both the installation and connecting process succeeded and can then configure their preferences.

Sample of expected `RegisterProviderLink` payload structure:

JSON
    
    
    {
       "data":{
          "linkId":"string", 
          "orgId":"string", 
          "marketplaceClientId":"string"
       }
    }
    

Explanation of attributes:

Name| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`linkId`| string  
required| The unique identifier of the user in the Invoice app  
`orgId`| string  
required| ID of the user company in the Invoice service, not the app  
`marketplaceClientId`| string  
required| `clientId` of the app in Pipedrive Marketplace  
  
  


* * *

## 

Invoicing API reference

[](#invoicing-api-reference)

* * *

### 

Authentication

[](#authentication)

All requests from Pipedrive to the app will be supplemented with an authentication header that uses the same `client_id` and `client_secret` as the OAuth token exchange in [OAuth authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization).  
E.g. `Authorization: Basic <base64(client_id:client_secret)> `

* * *

### 

API payloads

[](#api-payloads)

All API responses from the endpoints defined in the manifest are expected to be JSON, where data depends on the endpoint.

JSON
    
    
    { 
      "success": boolean,
      "data": "depends on the endpoint"
    }
