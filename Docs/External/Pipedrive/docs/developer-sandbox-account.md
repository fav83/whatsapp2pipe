# Developer sandbox account

[ __Suggest Edits](/edit/developer-sandbox-account)

Our [**developer sandbox account**](https://developers.pipedrive.com/) is essentially like a regular Pipedrive company account. These accounts provide app developers with a safe development and testing environment and are limited to 5 seats by default.
