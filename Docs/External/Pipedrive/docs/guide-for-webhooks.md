About webhooks

[](#about-webhooks)

* * *

**Webhooks** allow you to get programmatic notifications from Pipedrive about changes to your data as they happen. If you're new to webhooks, [read this guide](https://requestbin.com/blog/working-with-webhooks/) to learn more.

Rather than requiring you to pull information via our API, webhooks will **push** information to your endpoint. When one of those events is triggered (for example a new deal is added), Pipedrive will send this notification as an HTTP `POST` request, with a JSON body, to the endpoint(s) you specify. 

You can create a new webhook in the Pipedrive web app via [_Settings > Tools and apps > (Tools) > Webhooks_](https://app.pipedrive.com/settings/webhooks). The **maximum limit** of webhooks is **40 different webhooks per user**. 

  * **Regular users** can create/delete webhooks but only under their own Permission level. 
  * **Admin users** can manage webhooks for all users in their company.

Here's what the **Create new webhook** form looks like **for the Admin user** because the Permission level drop-down menu is unavailable to Regular users:

Now let us explain the parameters for events both in and outside of Pipedrive:

## 

Events in Pipedrive

[](#events-in-pipedrive)

* * *

With an event, you can filter what kind of events you want to receive (few example events [below](/docs/guide-for-webhooks#examples-and-explanations)).

Parameter| Description  
---|---  
Event action| The action done on an event object. Use `*.*` for all events. [Supported event actions](/docs/guide-for-webhooks#supported-event-actions).  
Event object| The object the action is done on. Use `*.*` for all objects. [Supported event object types](/docs/guide-for-webhooks#supported-object-types).  
Permission level| The permission level specifies the permissions under which the webhooks are being sent out. Webhooks about objects are not sent if the selected user does not have permitted access to them.  
  
> ## ðŸ“˜
> 
> Events in Pipedrive are triggered both from the Pipedrive UI and from the API calls.

## 

Endpoint outside Pipedrive

[](#endpoint-outside-pipedrive)

* * *

Parameter| Description  
---|---  
Endpoint URL| An endpoint URL is the HTTP endpoint where your preferred events are sent. We can send them only to a full, valid, publicly accessible URL.  
HTTP Auth username and password (if required)| HTTP auth username and HTTP auth password are optional depending on your server setup. Webhooks service will send these Basic Authentication credentials in the header of every HTTP request. To protect your data, we strongly recommend using authenticated HTTPS requests. Note that we do not support self-signed certificates.

Retry field explanation

[](#retry-field-explanation)

* * *

> ## ðŸ“˜
> 
> For a successful delivery, we'll accept any 2XX status code.  
>  Anything other is counted as a failure and the retry policy will commence.

You can determine the number of delivery attempts according to the value of the `retry` field in the payload (see the format above). Learn about the retry logic [below](/docs/guide-for-webhooks#retry-logic).

Retry value| Value explanation  
---|---  
`0`| Webhook delivered on the first attempt  
`1`| Webhook delivered on the first retry  
`2`| Webhook delivered on the second retry  
`3`| Webhook delivered on the third retry

Current and previous

[](#current-and-previous)

* * *

In the `current` and `previous` blocks, the standard data of each object is placed in a way which conforms to our [API Reference](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1) with the following rules:

Action| Event name| Current| Previous  
---|---|---|---  
Deleting objects| deleted.[object]| null| last state (object)  
Adding new objects| added.[object]| current state (object)| null  
Updating objects| updated.[object]| current state (object)| previous state (object)  
Merging objects| merged.[object] (about the object merged into)  
deleted.[object] (about the object merged)| current state (object)  
  
null| previous state (object)  
  
previous state (object)

## 

Examples and explanations

[](#examples-and-explanations)

* * *

It's possible to set up notifications for events like `added.organization`, `\*.deal`, `updated.\*`, `deleted.person`. When setting up notifications, note that event objects are not combinations but refer back to themselves. For example, if you want to have a webhook show when a deal changes stages, you should choose `deal` as the event object, not `stage`, and then choose `update` as the event action. If you pick `stage` as the event object, the webhook will send notifications when things, such as stage name or other settings of the stage, have been changed.

You can see all possible webhooks that can be created in Pipedrive [here](/docs/list-of-webhooks).

## 

Status codes for Webhooks

[](#status-codes-for-webhooks)

* * *

You can see the status of the last attempt made by your webhook(s) in the webhook dashboard. The webhooks dashboard is available under _Tools and integrations > Webhooks_ inside Pipedrive.

There are three status code ranges or messages that are expected:

  * A `2XX` status code range shows a successful delivery of your webhook request.
  * A `500` status code indicates a server error, usually on the client-side.
  * An `Error` status message is shown if there is a timeout of the webhook request, the webhook is blocked, or there is an internal problem on Pipedriveâ€™s end. If you encounter this error, you can contact our support team, who can further inquire into the logs of these requests.



For a successful delivery, we'll accept any `2XX` status code. Any other code or message is counted as a failure, which means the retry logic, as well as the webhooks policy, will commence.

  


* * *

## 

Retry logic

[](#retry-logic)

* * *

Webhooks retry policy is as follows:

  * In case the original notification sending attempt fails (**due to receiving a non-`2XX` response code or exceeding timeout of 10 seconds**), we will try **3 more times** : after 3, 30 and 150 seconds. If it still fails for each of those attempts, it is counted as one non-successful delivery.
  * If there are no successful deliveries on 3 consecutive days, we will **delete** this specific webhook.



> ## ðŸ“˜
> 
> Outgoing webhooks are **not** subject to our API rate limit.

* * *

## 

Webhooks policy

[](#webhooks-policy)

* * *

The webhooks policy is applied to both general and [App-Specific](/docs/webhooks-for-apps) webhooks. 

Pipedrive has a Ban System for webhooks, which means that every time the original notification sending attempt fails on the first try (due to receiving a non-`2xx` response code or exceeding a timeout of 10 seconds) the ban counter will increase by one.

When the ban counter reaches **10** on a webhook, this specific webhook will be banned for **30 minutes**. When the ban time is over, the webhook is reactivated and the ban counter is set back to zero. 

Do take note that:

  * If a webhook is unreachable on the first try, its ban count will increase, and the standard retry logic will be applied. If the webhook is unreachable during retries, the ban counter wonâ€™t be increased.
  * If a webhook is banned, the webhook's event message is lost. No data will be saved for retries after the ban.



If there are **no** successful deliveries to a webhook on **3 consecutive days** , we will delete it.
