Just like [JSON panels](/docs/app-extensions-json-panels), custom panels are found as a panel in the left sidebar section **inside the detail view** of deals, people, and organizations.

Each app can have **one custom or JSON panel per detail view**. This means each app can have **3 different panels** (custom or JSON) altogether ‚Äì 1 for each detail view (deal, people, and organization).

The custom panel will appear at the top of the left sidebar section. Users can change, hide, and reorder their location with other sections in the sidebar.

How to troubleshoot a custom panel

[](#how-to-troubleshoot-a-custom-panel)

* * *

**Note: The app has to be installed by the user for them to be able to use custom UI extensions.**

A custom panel is dependent on the iframe URL provided in Developer Hub. If users can‚Äôt see the panel‚Äôs content, this could mean:

  * The web content failed to load
  * The runtime `id` provided was wrong
  * The [SDK](https://github.com/pipedrive/app-extensions-sdk) wasn‚Äôt initialized > if the iframe takes more than 10 seconds to initialize via our SDK, the iframe won‚Äôt be displayed to the user.



Please check the iframe URL you provided, its frontend and backend capabilities, and the runtime `id` provided to the [SDK](https://github.com/pipedrive/app-extensions-sdk).
