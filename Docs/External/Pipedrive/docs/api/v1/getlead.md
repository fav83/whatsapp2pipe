## Get one lead

Returns details of a specific lead. If a lead contains custom fields, the fields' values will be included in the response in the same format as with the `Deals` endpoints. If a custom field's value hasn't been set for the lead, it won't appear in the response. Please note that leads do not have a separate set of custom fields, instead they inherit the custom fieldsâ€™ structure from deals.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | In | Required | Description |
|------|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | path | Yes | The ID of the lead |
