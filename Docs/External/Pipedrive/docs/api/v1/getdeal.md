## Get details of a deal

Returns the details of a specific deal. Note that this also returns some additional fields which are not present when asking for all deals â€“ such as deal age and stay in pipeline stages. Also note that custom fields appear as long hashes in the resulting data. These hashes can be mapped against the `key` value of dealFields.
