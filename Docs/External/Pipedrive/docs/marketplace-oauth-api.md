# OAuth 2.0 overview

[ __Suggest Edits](/edit/marketplace-oauth-api)

The recommended authorization protocol for all public apps available in the Pipedrive Marketplace is the industry-standard [OAuth 2.0 protocol](https://oauth.net/2/). OAuth 2.0 allows apps granular access to usersâ€™ data and provides a secure and easy-to-use connection between the app and Pipedrive.

Using OAuth 2.0 authorization allows all requests you make to Pipedrive API to be authorized by a user. A Pipedrive user must grant access to their data for the app. As proof of this grant, every request to our API must contain a valid `access_token`. Every `access_token` is bound to:

  * The Pipedrive user who granted the access
  * The company of the user (if a user is connected to multiple accounts, then itâ€™s dependent on the company theyâ€™re logged into when authorizing the app)
  * The 3rd party app which asked for this access
  * A [set of permissions](/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations) that will be allowed
  * An expiration date



To get access to the usersâ€™ data, the app must be registered in the Pipedrive Marketplace as this is where the app installation (i.e. access-granting) process starts.

Steps to take to get the `access_token`

[](#steps-to-take-to-get-the-access_token)

* * *

  1. Get your [developer sandbox account](https://developers.pipedrive.com/)
  2. Register your app in [Developer Hub](/docs/marketplace-registering-the-app) to get the [`client_id`, `client_secret`](/docs/client-id-and-client-secret) and subsequently, choose relevant [scopes](/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations) for your app
  3. Implement the OAuth 2.0 protocol by following our guide for [OAuth authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization)



Now you should have the `access_token` and `refresh_token` necessary for making requests to Pipedriveâ€™s API.

How to authenticate the requests?

[](#how-to-authenticate-the-requests)

* * *

All requests to the API should be authenticated with the `access_token` by providing its value in the Authorization header:

URL
    
    
    GET https://{COMPANYDOMAIN}.pipedrive.com/api/v1/deals -H 'Authorization: Bearer v1u:AQIABHj...XNYcKcd_8LIrqRhRT9GQs4XW1MawrF_K4yg'
