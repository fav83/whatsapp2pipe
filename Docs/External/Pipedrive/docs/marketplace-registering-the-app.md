Register a new public app

[](#register-a-new-public-app)

* * *

> ## üöß
> 
> NB: Do pick your app type carefully, as it cannot be changed later on Developer Hub.

To register a new app, click on the green ‚ÄúCreate an app‚Äù button (or ‚Äú+ Create an app‚Äù if you have existing apps) followed by ‚ÄúCreate public app‚Äù. This is also where you‚Äôd see a list of your registered public and private apps if you have any.

## 

App registration form

[](#app-registration-form)

* * *

The app registration form for public apps is divided into two categories containing seven different tabs.

You can save your app anytime by clicking the green ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button. To exit the form and return to your Developer Hub dashboard, click the left-pointing arrow next to your app's name.

Read on to find out how and what to fill in each tab.

> ## üìò
> 
> **Disclaimer:** The Marketplace team reserves the right to make small changes to text fields and images uploaded to the app's listing to give the best possible user experience and make the page discoverable in search. You'll be notified when something is edited.

### 

Basic info

[](#basic-info)

![Developer Hub > public app - basic info](https://files.readme.io/8f6169e-Developer_Hub_-_public_app_-_Basic_info.png)

This tab has two required fields ‚Äì App name and OAuth Callback URL. Once you‚Äôve filled this in, click the green ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button to save the form. You‚Äôll then automatically be brought to the second tab ‚Äì ‚ÄúOAuth & access scopes‚Äù, where you‚Äôll get your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

Field| Description  
---|---  
App name (required)| Insert your app‚Äôs name by how it will be recognized in the Marketplace.  
  
_Example: Car Services App_  
Callback URL (required, one URL per app)| Insert a link where an authorization code will be sent if the user approves or declines the installation of your app. This link is also where we return the user after successful authentication. Technically, a callback URL is the same thing as an OAuth `redirect_uri`.  
  
It‚Äôs okay to insert a non-functioning URL when creating a new app if you can update this field with a proper URL after implementing the logic needed to accept user authorization in your code. Please keep in mind that we allow only one callback URL per app.  
  
_Example:<https://www.carservicesapp.com/API/v2/callback>_  
  
### 

OAuth & access scopes

[](#oauth--access-scopes)

![Developer Hub > public app - OAuth & access scopes](https://files.readme.io/8086d43-Developer_Hub_-_public_app_-_OAuth__access_scopes.png)

Field| Description  
---|---  
Access scopes (required)| Using [scopes](/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations), you can specify precisely what data access your application needs. Your selection will depend significantly on the endpoints you use in your app. You can also select the respective scope in this section if you are building a [manifest-based app extension](/docs/app-extensions#manifest-based-app-extensions).  
  
_Example:_  
‚úÖ _Read users data_  
‚úÖ _See recent account activity_  
Installation URL| This is where you can add an optional URL to which users will be redirected when clicking the ‚ÄúProceed to Install‚Äù button in the marketplace listing page.  
  
Use it when you need to start [app authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization#step-1-requesting-authorization) **outside** of the Marketplace, redirect users to a custom landing page, or implement the [state parameter](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization-state-parameter) for additional security.  
Client ID| This is where you will get your app‚Äôs unique `client_id` and `client_secret` for [OAuth authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization).  
  
> ## üöß
> 
> The user has the option to either **accept or deny all scopes**. Because of this, it‚Äôs a good idea to **build apps that only request necessary scopes** for your particular use case.

> ## üëç
> 
> Once you‚Äôve completed filling up the Basic info and OAuth & access scopes, we advise you to **start installing your app and testing it** to see how it works. You can do so by clicking on the green ‚ÄúInstall & test‚Äù button in the bottom left of the tab.

### 

App extensions

Onboarding for users

[](#onboarding-for-users)

With the user onboarding guide, you can onboard users to your app with step-by-step instructions or a feature review to improve app adoption and drive more customers. The guide will appear once users install the app and return to Pipedrive (web app reload is required). Users can access the guide at any time from the app page (Settings ‚Üí Tools and apps ‚Üí Marketplace apps).

> ## üöß
> 
> To publish the onboarding guide, your app needs to pass our [app approval process](/docs/marketplace-app-approval-process). Once it's approved, you can edit it any time without approval process.

The guide is a separate step in the app creation flow in Developer Hub (App Settings ‚Üí Onboarding for users).

![](https://files.readme.io/9883b7e-Navigation.png)

#### 

Content blocks

[](#content-blocks)

Use content blocks to break your guide into individual segments, either to introduce separate individual features or to guide the user through sequential steps.

##### 

Tips for content blocks:

[](#tips-for-content-blocks)

  * Make sure the guide is simple to follow.
  * If your app has multiple features or steps, select the crucial ones and add a link to an in-depth guide.
  * If your guide lists instructions in a specific order, pay attention to the chronological sequence.
  * Use arrows to indicate a series of actions. _Example: Click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù ‚Üí Select your plan ‚Üí Check the checkbox to continue._
  * Update the onboarding guide when making changes to your app‚Äôs flow.



Open the content block and fill out the necessary information.

![](https://files.readme.io/c9961fe-Content_block.png)

Field| Description  
---|---  
Title | Write a short title that summarizes the functionality or onboarding step (max 70 characters). The title will appear as the text block header.  
  
_Example: Manage car orders straight from the deal view_  
Description| Provide a clear and concise overview of the feature and its location or instructions for this step (max 200 characters). The text block description will appear on the modal‚Äôs main text block under the title.  
  
_Example: Navigate to a deal detail view and head to the side panel. You can add new orders, see all linked car orders and manage their details_  
Learn more link (optional)| Here, you can add any additional info about this step with a link to an external page related to it. The page will open in a new tab.  
  
_Example:<https://support.carprojectmanagerapp.com/en/article/pipedrive-integration-setup>_  
Image| Add an image to illustrate this feature or onboarding step and indicate its location on the screen.  
  
**Image requirements:**  
Format: PNG, JPG  
Max size: 100KB  
Aspect ratio: 9:5  
Width and height: 720 x 400  
Have purple borders (20px)  
  
##### 

Tips for image content: 

[](#tips-for-image-content)

  * The image should contain as little text as possible. Replace text elements with gray blocks wherever possible.
  * Prioritize important information so as not to overwhelm users and keep them focused.
  * Highlight crucial information with a bright color, different font weight or your own highlighting style.
  * Avoid red and yellow color palettes whenever possible. These are associated with error and warning states and may disrupt and confuse users.
  * Optimize image size for web content. The smaller the image size, the quicker it will load for the user. 



* * *

To add an additional content block, click the ‚Äú+ Add a content block‚Äù button below the list. You can include up to four blocks and change their position by dragging them up or down. You can delete any of your blocks by clicking the recycle bin icon.

Video link and info

[](#video-link-and-info)

> ## üëç
>

Field| Description  
---|---  
Video link| The video should demonstrate your onboarding process or the most important features of your solution, helping new users get started using your tool.  
  
We currently support links to the following video hosting platforms: YouTube, Vimeo, Vidyard and Wistia.  
  
**General guidelines:**  
The video should be 1 to 3 minutes long. This duration allows you to demonstrate key features and guide users through the initial steps without overwhelming them with excessive information. Keeping the video short and focused will help maintain user engagement and ensure they absorb the most important bits quickly and effectively.  
  
If your app integrates Pipedrive with another tool, your video should clearly explain your solution‚Äôs benefits and unique features.  
  
_Example:<https://youtu.be/5a7OzJBG3kk?si=eN2c5W>_  
Video title (optional)| The video title should be short (max 80 characters) and descriptive. It will be displayed as the text block‚Äôs title at the bottom of the video player overlay.  
  
_Example: Get started with Car Project Managers app in Pipedrive_  
Video description (optional)| The video description should clearly describe the video‚Äôs content and what the viewer can gain from watching it (max 120 characters).  
  
It will be displayed as the body text block at the bottom of the video player overlay.  
  
_Example: Watch this explanatory video on how to get started with this app and where to find the key functionalities._

##### 

Learn article link

[](#learn-article-link)

Optional: Add an onboarding article link. The article will open in a new tab.

---|---|---  
Learn article link| Add a link to an article about your onboarding flow or features overview. The article should explain either the first steps users need to take to experience the benefits of your tool or delve into your app‚Äôs key features.  
  
_Example:<https://support.carprojectmanagerapp.com/en/article/pipedrive-integration-winbridge>_|   
| |   
  
> ## üëç

Install and test your draft app

[](#install-and-test-your-draft-app)

* * *

Installing and testing your draft app is a **crucial step** before sending your app for review. It enables you to

  * Ensure everything in your app runs smoothly
  * Check that you've implemented the [**mandatory** installation flows](/docs/app-installation-flows)
  * Identify and address potential issues early on
  * Pass our app approval process faster



NB: app testing only works for users in your sandbox account and cannot be shared with external users.

To install and test your app, click the ‚ÄúInstall and test‚Äù notification above your app‚Äôs name or the ‚ÄúInstall & test‚Äù option from the three-dot menu.

![Developer Hub > public app - install & test](https://files.readme.io/02b82c9-Developer_Hub_-_Public_app_-_install_and_test.png)

You can also click the green ‚ÄúInstall & test‚Äù button at the bottom left of the OAuth & access scopes and App extensions tabs.

![Developer Hub > public app - install & test from the OAuth & access scopes tab](https://files.readme.io/ed7ea90-Developer_Hub_-_Public_app_-_Install__test_-_OAuth__access_scopes.png)
