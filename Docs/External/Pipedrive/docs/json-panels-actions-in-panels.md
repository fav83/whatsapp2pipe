Global actions in the JSON panel

Global actions are app actions for the entire JSON panel that is **specific to the detail view** that the user is in (deal, people, organization). As your JSON panel can be in [three detail views altogether](/docs/app-extensions-json-panels#visibility-in-the-ui), you can customize global actions for each app panel in each of the detail view.

Represented by a green action button unique to app panels, global actions can be found at the bottom left of the app panel. This is where you can add one main app action to be featured and two additional actions to be included in the global actions dropdown menu. You can have a **maximum of 3 actions** within global actions.

The actions within global actions can be a [link](/docs/app-extensions-actions) or a [JSON modal](/docs/app-extensions-json-modals). This means you can use

  * Links to reroute users from Pipedrive to an external page hosted by your app to complete an action
  * JSON modals to allow users to complete full actions in Pipedrive using an interactive component (a modal)



You can also add an additional external link to global actions by extending the API response with an [external link](/docs/json-panels-adding-a-panel#external-links) object.

Actions in panels can be added in the same section of Developer Hub where you add your JSON panels inside _Developer Hub > App extensions_.

  * Global actions are added via _links_ or _JSON modal_
  * Object and field actions are added via _App extensions > My added extensions > \+ Actions to this panel_

How to add global actions

[](#how-to-add-global-actions)

Adding global actions to your panel is the same as adding a [link](/docs/app-extensions-actions) or a [JSON modal](/docs/app-extensions-json-modals). You can have a **maximum of 3 actions** within global actions.

### 

Link ‚Äì global action

[](#link--global-action)

URL (required)| The URL that handles the action in your app  
[JWT](https://jwt.io/) secret| If left empty, `client_secret` will be used by default  
Locations| The location where the action will be displayed in Pipedrive UI  
  
### 

JSON modal - global action

[](#json-modal---global-action)

A JSON modal allows users to complete actions with Pipedrive using an interactive component ‚Äì modal. Learn how to add a JSON modal [here](/docs/app-extensions-json-modals).

Field| Description  
---|---  
Action name (required)| Max 30 characters, in sentence-case

JSON schema(required)| The JSON schema for your JSON modal  
Locations| The location where the action will be displayed in Pipedrive UI  
  
### 

How to customize the order of global actions

[](#how-to-customize-the-order-of-global-actions)

By default, global actions are ordered by their creation timestamp. The newest one will be shown as the main action. This means that the last action saved (newest) will be the main action within the green global actions button, while the subsequent two actions you added before will be included in the dropdown menu.

![962](https://files.readme.io/d10ac6a-App_extensions_-_global_actions_-_Pipedrive.png)

Global actions at the bottom left of the app panel

In the picture example above, ‚ÄúAdd an order‚Äù was the latest action saved, while ‚ÄúView all orders‚Äù and ‚ÄúAccount settings‚Äù were saved earlier.

**Selecting the main action for global actions**

  * Go to _App extensions > My added extensions_ in Developer Hub
  * Find the JSON panel you want to customize global actions for
  * Click on the pencil icon to open the JSON panel form
  * Scroll to the bottom of the form to the ‚Äúmain action‚Äù field with a dropdown menu that enables you to select the main action for global actions

![1200](https://files.readme.io/e9a8885-App_extensions_-_JSON_panel_-_main_action_dropdown_menus.png)

The main action fields with a dropdown menu

Note that actions will **only appear** in the main action dropdown menu if both the link/JSON modal **and** the JSON panel you are customizing global actions for have the **same detail view** selected in _Locations_.

  * For example, suppose you want the ‚ÄúAdd new order‚Äù link action to be the main action for global actions in your JSON panel within _deal details_. To do so, ensure _deal details_ is selected as a location for the ‚ÄúAdd new order‚Äù link action **and** the JSON panel. Only then will you be able to find ‚ÄúAdd new order‚Äù link action in the main action dropdown menu in the JSON panel's form.



![Ensure your action's Location is the same as your JSON panel](https://files.readme.io/91464a3-App_extensions_-_main_link_action_for_global_actions.png)

Ensure your action's Location is the same as your JSON panel

![The action will then appear in the main action dropdown menu in the JSON panel's form](https://files.readme.io/6b12e04-App_extensions_-_JSON_panel_main_action_selection.png)

The action will then appear in the main action dropdown menu in the JSON panel's form

Should you want to use the same action as the main action for all global action, ensure that all three details views (deal, person, organization) are selected in Locations.

How to add object actions and field actions

[](#how-to-add-object-actions-and-field-actions)

  * Field actions are available for single object and multiple object panels, with one link or JSON modal action added to a field to allow users to interact with the data. Each panel object can have a **maximum of 3 fields with actions**.

Troubleshooting

[](#troubleshooting)

* * *

As there are only two types of actions ‚Äì [link](/docs/app-extensions-actions) and [JSON modal](/docs/app-extensions-json-modals), troubleshooting for actions in panels is the same as troubleshooting for these actions.

  * For links, please check within your app as link actions reroute users from Pipedrive to your app to complete the relevant action.
  * For JSON modals, please see [schema structure validation](/docs/app-extensions-json-modals#schema-structure-validation) and [schema data exchange on modal form submit](/docs/app-extensions-json-modals#schema-data-exchange-on-modal-form-submit).
