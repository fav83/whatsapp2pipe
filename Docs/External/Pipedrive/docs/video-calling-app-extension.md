Video calling access point inside Pipedrive

[](#video-calling-access-point-inside-pipedrive)

* * *

The video calling app extension gives app users the option to create, manage, and join video calls and meetings directly in Pipedrive‚Äôs activities.

Users can add/generate links for video calls by using video calling apps

Once the user has added a video call to an activity, additional information can be displayed with the video call link e.g. the duration and/or invitation information of the video call. 

![2386](https://files.readme.io/95a0a8f-Screenshot_2020-09-03_at_16.13.59.png)

The fields Pipedrive fetches from video calling endpoints mapped in the manifest

Afterward, the information connected to the video call will then be displayed together with the activity throughout Pipedrive, e.g., in the contacts list, calendar view, deal detail view. 

![2276](https://files.readme.io/b74c941-Screenshot_2020-09-03_at_16.15.33.png)

When an activity has been saved with the video calling app extension, a button will appear in the deal details view to join the call. Once clicked, the button redirects to the video call URL.

Development process

[](#development-process)

* * *

To extend your app‚Äôs capabilities to the activities modal, we‚Äôve built the logic of reverse APIs, where Pipedrive will request information from a third-party video calling service‚Äôs API. These requests will be made to the endpoints that are defined in a [manifest](/docs/app-extensions-invoicing#manifest-for-invoicing-app-extension) uploaded to the [Developer Hub](/docs/marketplace-registering-the-app#app-extensions) by the app creator.

  * To begin, you‚Äôll need access to the [Developer Hub](https://app.pipedrive.com/developer-hub), where your app is maintained
  * In Developer Hub, click on your app‚Äôs name and go to the OAuth & access scopes tab
  * Select the **video calls integration** scope**
  * Make sure that your app is connected to Pipedrive or a third-party service (if the app acts as an intermediary) and has finalized the connection. When a user has installed your app, the app will call the `POST /userProviderLink` endpoint and send the user information to Pipedrive.
  * Following this, get acquainted with what should be added to the [manifest](/docs/video-calling-app-extension#manifest-for-video-calling-app-extension), **create** the manifest for your app, and **add** it to your app‚Äôs listing in Developer Hub
  * Finish up your app and submit it for [the app approval process](/docs/marketplace-app-approval-process)

Connecting the app

[](#connecting-the-app)

* * *

### 

Connecting your app to Pipedrive

[](#connecting-your-app-to-pipedrive)

The application is installed by clicking ‚Äúinstall‚Äù within the Pipedrive Marketplace. Once the user has agreed to the [scopes](/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations), the browser gets redirected to the app's registered `callback URL` ([step 3 of OAuth authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization#step-3-callback-to-your-app)). At this moment, the app needs to fetch and permanently store the OAuth tokens it receives from Pipedrive ([step 4 of the OAuth authorization](/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization#step-4-and-step-5-getting-the-tokens)). For video calling apps, we require generating a unique identifier string (e.g., a `UUID`) for each connection/link, which Pipedrive will use for all API calls executed against the app.

### 

Finalizing the connection

[](#finalizing-the-connection)

After the unique identifier has been generated and the OAuth tokens stored, the app must register itself as a data provider by calling the `POST /userProviderLink` endpoint. To finalize everything, the app should redirect the user to the `redirectUrl` that was received as the response for the registration call against the Pipedrive API. On that page, the user will see if both the installation and connecting process succeeded and can then configure their preferences.

### 

POST /userProviderLink

[](#post-userproviderlink)

A video calling provider must call this endpoint after a user has installed the video calling app so that the new user's information is sent.

**URL**

    https://{COMPANYDOMAIN}.pipedrive.com/api/v1/meetings/userProviderLink

      user_provider_id: 'string',
      user_id: 001,
      company_id: 007,
      marketplace_client_id: 'string',
    }
    

Name| Type| Required/optional| Description  
---|---|---|---  
`user_provider_id`| string, UUID| Required| A unique `user_provider_id` that has to be in `UUID` format  
`user_id`| number| Required| Pipedrive user ID of the user that installed the integration

## 

Manifest for video calling app extension

[](#manifest-for-video-calling-app-extension)

* * *

A manifest describes, in a special contract format, the endpoints to which Pipedrive‚Äôs API will request. Based on the responses of those requests, the data received will be displayed inside Pipedrive UI in a pre-defined format. For the video calling app extension, the data received from the endpoints will be displayed in the activity modal.

The manifest for your app will need the appropriate URLs of a video calling service‚Äôs API endpoints. Once the manifest for your video calling app is submitted to Developer Hub, it will be validated against a pre-defined schema.

### 

Template for video calling manifest

[](#template-for-video-calling-manifest)

The file below defines the JSON schema of the manifest for an app that wants to display its contents inside the Pipedrive activities modal.

For your app‚Äôs manifest, just **add your own value** for `clientID` and corresponding URLs of a video calling service‚Äôs API requests to `endpoints`.

JSON
    
    
    {
    	"version": "v202049",
    	"clientId": "dummyclientid123",
    	"endpoints": {
    		"postMeeting": "https://example.com/api/:linkId/",
    		"deleteMeeting": "https://example.com/api/:linkId/meetings/:meetingId",
    		"patchUpdateMeeting": "https://example.com/:linkId/meetings/:meetingId"
    	}
    }
    

### 

Manifest URL format

[](#manifest-url-format)

`:linkId` must be included in all endpoints' URLs. `:linkId` will be replaced with the unique identifier that the vendor registers the connection with. The unique identifier represents the connection between the app and the user. 

`:meetingId` must be included in `deleteMeeting` and `patchUpdateMeeting` endpoint‚Äôs URLs. The `:meetingId` will be replaced with a unique meeting ID provided by the `postMeeting` endpoint by the provider.

###
