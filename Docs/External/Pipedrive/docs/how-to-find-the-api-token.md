# How to find the API token

[ __Suggest Edits](/edit/how-to-find-the-api-token)

To validate your requests, you'll need your `api_token` \- this means that our system will need to know who you are and be able to connect all actions you do with your chosen Pipedrive account. 

Keep in mind that a user has a different `api_token` for every company the user is a part of.

You can get the API token **manually** from the Pipedrive web app by going to _account name (on the top right) > Company settings > Personal preferences > API_ or by clicking [here](https://app.pipedrive.com/settings/api) (in case you have multiple companies open at the same time, this link will redirect you to the API token of the last opened company).

Disclaimer: Never disclose your real API token!

If you don't see _API_ next to the _Your companies_ tab in web app's _Settings_ follow our tutorial about [enabling API](/docs/enabling-api-for-company-users).
