# Deleting an app

[ __Suggest Edits](/edit/marketplace-deleting-the-existing-app)

You can remove your app from the Marketplace by following the steps below. Deleting your app will **remove** it from the Marketplace and **uninstall** it from all existing customers. You will also have to handle [token revocation](/docs/app-uninstallation#token-revocation) (an essential aspect of [app uninstallation](/docs/app-uninstallation)) from your side.

> Deleting the app is **irreversible**.

If you are sure about removing your app from the Marketplace, click the red “Delete” button.

Your app will now be uninstalled for all existing users. Each user who installed your app will receive a notification email about the app deletion, which will also be sent to you and the Pipedrive Marketplace team, together with the deletion reason you entered.

Step 4: Ensure you handle app uninstallation and token revocation

[](#step-4-ensure-you-handle-app-uninstallation-and-token-revocation)

* * *

As your app is now uninstalled for all existing users from Pipedrive, ensure that any user data and tokens saved on your app’s side are also removed.

> After completing the steps above, your app will no longer be visible in Developer Hub or listed in the Marketplace Catalog.
