Apps allow developers like you to add value to the lives of salespeople using Pipedrive. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre new to developing or have been doing it for years; we‚Äôre happy you‚Äôve decided to join our forces.

To enable your app to get through our approval process quickly without any obstacles, it‚Äôs important that you fully understand the process. This way, you‚Äôll have the utmost confidence when you submit your app to the Pipedrive Marketplace.

Jump to [the checklist](/docs/marketplace-app-approval-process#before-you-submit--a-checklist)!

Introduction

> Submitting the app is unnecessary if it‚Äôs only used internally. You can instead [create a Private app](/docs/marketplace-registering-a-private-app) and share it with any Pipedrive company using a direct installation link

After you have built and tested your app, submit your app to start the approval process. Each new public app submitted to the Pipedrive Marketplace has to pass our approval process to ensure the standards of quality and reliability that our customers (the salespeople) expect.

Here‚Äôs a high-level graph of the approval process:

> These requirements may change as we continuously enhance our marketplace and developer platform

To ensure that the apps submitted to our marketplace meet the highest standards and provide value to our customers, we have compiled a list of mandatory guidelines for you to follow. 

Following these guidelines will reduce the need for resubmissions, speed up the review process and ultimately increase the likelihood of successful app approval in the first review.
